#Spring VetPetApp + Thymeleaf+Spring Security Sample Application

##What's this?
VetPetApp was developed for veterinary operations. You can become a member of the system and then log in. It has a role-based structure. After becoming a member, you can add a role and assign the role. After the first user assigns the admin role to himself, he has to log out and log in again because he deletes it differently from other users. The animal can be searched by entering the name or surname of the owner and the relevant records can be examined if there are any. The registered pet owner can add his pet to the application through the pet owner detail form or after searching for his name in the system.
