#Spring VetPetApp + Thymeleaf+Spring Security Sample Application

##What's this?
VetPetApp was developed for veterinary operations. You can become a member of the system and then log in. It has a role-based structure. After becoming a member, you can add a role and assign the role. After the first user assigns the admin role to himself, he has to log out and log in again because he deletes it differently from other users. It can be searched by entering the animal name or the surname of the owner of the animal and can be examined if the relevant records are found. The registered animal owner can add his pet to the application via the animal owner detail form.
